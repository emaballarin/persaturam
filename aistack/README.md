# AIStack

AIStack is a deterministic and reliable way to *bootstrap* a full-featured research environment for Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence, mainly focused on *deep learning*, *deep probabilistic programming*, *Bayesian learning and inference*, *generative models*, and *AI-powered science and experimentation* in general.

AIStack is build around Facebook's PyTorch, Apache MXNet, Preferred Networks' Chainer as main deep learning frameworks, and ONNX as an inter-exchange format. Various related and machine-learning-specific Python packages are included too.

Continuum Analytics' *Anaconda Python Distribution* is the package manager of choice, together with pip (but with manually-resolved dependencies).

The software is released under the *GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3*.
