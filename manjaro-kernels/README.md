# manjaro-kernels

Customized kernels, ported from Arch Linux to Manjaro Linux following a *minimal modifications* philosophy.

**BEWARE!**
<br>The scripts were not initially meant for *public usage*. They are published here just because it does not currently exist a standardized procedure to install Con Kolivas' *linux-ck* and/or Alexandre Frade's *XanMod Linux* in Manjaro Linux. Thus, they *may* be useful to somebody trying to accomplish right the same.

These scripts **are optimized and customized for the zsh shell, an Intel Skylake processor and Nvidia proprietary drivers**. If this is not your scenario, you will definitely need to change some bits of the script (as the customizations are performed only at my-script-level).

**MAINTAINANCE NOTICE**
<br>I use these scripts personally, in the exact same version as they are here. And they are probably working for me. However, I am unable (mostly *time-wise*) to maintain this *sort-of-patchset* for the general audience.
<br>Nonetheless, I will enthusiastically review (and eventually merge) any pull requests that fix and/or enhance the scripts.
<br> Thank you for your understanding.
