# persaturam

A not-better-classified collection of random bits and pieces (self-contained scripts, single dotfiles, configuration files, lists, ...) that could easily (and rationally) be just simple gists.

However, the inability to make/accept pull requests, manage issues, etc. and the lack of scalability with the number of different gists lead to this repository.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This *may* include **untested**, **non-portable**, **flawed**, **deliberately bugged**, **experimental**, **unsafe**, **even dangerous** code. Use it freely, but not carelessly!
